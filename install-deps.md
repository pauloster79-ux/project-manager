# Install Dependencies

The Catalyst components require additional dependencies. Run this command in the `apps/web` directory:

```bash
npm install @headlessui/react@^1.7.17 clsx@^2.0.0
```

Or if you prefer yarn:

```bash
yarn add @headlessui/react@^1.7.17 clsx@^2.0.0
```

After installing these dependencies, the linting errors should be resolved and the app should work properly with the real Catalyst components.
